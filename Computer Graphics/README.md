`Raytracer.cc` code can be provided on request, but cannot be posted publicly as per the professor of the course.

Here are a few samples of the outputs my raytracer program could produce.
- Anti-aliasing (feathering edges of models) demonstration - low resolution due to immense runtime
- Simple Scenes - one model, one light source per scene
- Complex Scene - multiple models, multiple light sources, refraction, reflection
