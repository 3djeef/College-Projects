Raytracer code can be provided on request, but cannot be posted publicly. Here are a few samples of the outputs my raytracer program could produce.
- Anti-aliasing (less crisp edges) demonstration - low resolution due to immense runtime
- Simple Scenes - one model per scene
- Complex Scene - multiple models, multiple light sources, refraction, reflection
